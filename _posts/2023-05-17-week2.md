# Lots of images!

## But first, a review of where I am at currently
Okay, so it's been about two weeks since the release of Assignment 3, and I am enjoying it for the most part.
Some hiccups that have been happening:
- Codespace CPU is ridiculously slow
- Google Collab isn't very collaborative, unless I am just missing something
- Trying to acquire the CIFAKE images directly from Kaggle is very tricky, an easy solution I used instead was to just download and upload the files directly

It seems the image downloading issues I had last week are following on with a lot of other students currently, so I am glad I managed to sort out my images and don't have to download any more.
