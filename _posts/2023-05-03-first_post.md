# Hello world and readers (3rd May)

## Day 1: A3 Unleashed

Personally, I find this assignment, although difficult and a learning curve, to be much more useful overall especially due to the real world use cases applicable. Another pro from this assignment is that we get to learn and work on brand new things, such as CIFAKE (much more engaging than stuff from 1996).
