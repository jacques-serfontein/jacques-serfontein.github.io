# The end is nye!

## Let's start with where I am at currently!
I have completed most of the assignment so far, Q3 was a worry to me at first as I thought I would have to develop my own ML technique, such as a CNN from scratch. However, I decided to use the same method as Q2 to see what my accuracy would be, and with the standard resnet18 in the *vision_learner*, I managed to get an accuracy of 95%! So, this post will mainly discuss the hyperparameters within the *vision_learner* model. As an aside, upon some initial research, I found an existing paper - written by Jordan J. Bird and Ahmad Lotfi - discussing the CIFAKE dataset, along with an in depth analysis of the dataset using a CNN with hyperparameter tuning. You can find this [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14126.pdf)

## vision_learner - what can I do with it?
